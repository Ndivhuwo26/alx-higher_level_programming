Inheritance in Python (0x0A) allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, referred to as the base or parent class. This feature enables code reuse and facilitates creating new classes with similar functionality as existing ones, while also allowing for customization and extension through overriding and adding new methods and attributes in the derived or child classes.
