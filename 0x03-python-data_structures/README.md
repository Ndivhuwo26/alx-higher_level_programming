0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples




Lists:
Definition: Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. They are mutable sequences, meaning you can modify the elements after the list has been created.
Syntax: Lists are created using square brackets [] and elements are separated by commas. For example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Features:
Lists can contain elements of different data types: integers, floats, strings, other lists, etc.
Elements in a list are ordered and can be accessed using index positions.
Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.
They support various operations like appending, extending, slicing, sorting, etc.
Tuples:
Definition: Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable sequences, meaning once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements.
Syntax: Tuples are created using parentheses () and elements are separated by commas. For example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
Features:
Tuples can also contain elements of different data types, similar to lists.
Elements in a tuple are ordered and can be accessed using index positions, just like lists.
Tuples are immutable, so you cannot change the elements once the tuple is created.
They are often used to represent fixed collections of items, like coordinates, RGB color values, etc.
Tuples are generally faster than lists because of their immutability.
In summary, lists and tuples are both sequence data types in Python. Lists are mutable, allowing modifications, while tuples are immutable, making them suitable for situations where you need a fixed collection of items that should not be changed.
