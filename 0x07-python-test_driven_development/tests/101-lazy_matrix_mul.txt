Module Name: 101-lazy_matrix_mul.py

Description:
This module provides a function `lazy_matrix_mul()` to perform matrix multiplication efficiently. It uses lazy evaluation for improved performance.

Functions:
1. lazy_matrix_mul(): 
   Description: Multiplies two matrices using lazy evaluation.
   Parameters: 
     - matrix_a: First matrix (list of lists).
     - matrix_b: Second matrix (list of lists).
   Returns:
     - The result of multiplying the two matrices.

Usage:
1. Import the module:
   `from 101-lazy_matrix_mul import lazy_matrix_mul`

2. Call the `lazy_matrix_mul()` function with two matrices as arguments:
   `result_matrix = lazy_matrix_mul(matrix_a, matrix_b)`


Note:
- Matrices must be provided as lists of lists.
- The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for matrix multiplication to be valid.
