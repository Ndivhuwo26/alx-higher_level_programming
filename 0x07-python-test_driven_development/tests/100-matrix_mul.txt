Function Description: The matrix_mul function performs matrix multiplication between two matrices represented as lists of lists (m_a and m_b).

Usage:

Import the matrix_mul function from the module.
Call the function with two matrices (m_a and m_b) as arguments.
Examples:

Multiply two matrices with matching dimensions: matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
Multiply matrices with different dimensions: matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])
Error Handling:

Ensure at least two arguments are provided, otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
If the matrices cannot be multiplied due to incompatible dimensions, a ValueError is raised.
Matrices must not be empty lists, otherwise, a ValueError is raised.
Matrices must be lists containing lists of integers or floats, otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
The length of rows in matrices m_a and m_b must be consistent, otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
Invalid Matrices:

Matrices must be lists of lists, and each row must contain only integers or floats.
The length of rows in matrices must be consistent.
Ensure you handle these error conditions properly when using the matrix_mul function.
