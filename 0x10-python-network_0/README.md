0x10. Python - Network #0
This project focuses on understanding and implementing basic network communication using Python. It covers essential topics such as making HTTP requests, parsing responses, and handling various network-related tasks. Here's a brief overview of the key concepts and tasks you might encounter in this project:

HTTP Requests:

Learn how to use Python's requests module to send HTTP requests.
Understand the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how to use them.
Handling Responses:

Parse and extract data from HTTP responses.
Work with response headers, status codes, and content.
Query Parameters and Payload:

Send query parameters and payload data in your HTTP requests.
Handle URL encoding and form data submission.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for network requests.
Understand common HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and how to handle them gracefully.
Headers and Cookies:

Send custom headers and cookies with your requests.
Manage session data using cookies.
JSON Data:

Work with JSON data in your requests and responses.
Parse JSON responses and construct JSON payloads for POST requests.
Authentication:

Implement basic authentication mechanisms.
Handle API keys, tokens, and other authentication methods.
Scripting:

Write Python scripts to automate network tasks.
Use scripts to interact with web APIs and perform tasks like data retrieval, updates, and deletions.
