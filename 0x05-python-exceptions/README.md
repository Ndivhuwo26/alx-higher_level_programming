Python - Exceptions


Error Handling: Python exceptions allow you to handle errors and exceptional conditions that occur during program execution. Instead of crashing the program, exceptions provide a way to gracefully handle errors and continue execution.

Types of Exceptions: Python has a wide range of built-in exceptions for different types of errors. Some common built-in exceptions include TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, KeyError, FileNotFoundError, and IOError, among others.

Try-Except Blocks: The primary mechanism for handling exceptions in Python is the try-except block. Code that may raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and if an exception occurs, it's caught by the corresponding except block.

Exception Hierarchy: Python's exception hierarchy allows for more specific exception handling. You can catch specific exceptions or catch more general exceptions higher up in the hierarchy.

Finally Block: Optionally, you can use a finally block after the except block to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This block is useful for cleanup operations that should always be performed, such as closing files or releasing resources.

Custom Exceptions: Python also allows you to define custom exceptions by creating new classes that derive from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses
