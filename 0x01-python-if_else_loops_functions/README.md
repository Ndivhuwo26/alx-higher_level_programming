0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

Conditional Statements (if, else, elif): Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. if statements check a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is True. else statements execute a block of code if the if condition is False. elif statements provide an alternative condition to check if the previous if or elif conditions are False.

Loops (for loops, while loops): Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. for loops iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute the block of code for each item in the sequence. while loops continue executing the block of code as long as a specified condition is True.

Functions: Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, improving readability, and promoting code reusability. Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and a block of code. They can optionally return a value using the return statement
