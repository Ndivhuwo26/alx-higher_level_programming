Python - Everything is object" refers to a fundamental concept in the Python programming language where everything, including integers, functions, classes, and even the code itself, is represented as objects. In Python, an object is an instance of a class, and every value in Python is an object.


Everything is an Object: In Python, every entity is an object, including simple data types like integers, floats, and strings, as well as more complex types like lists, dictionaries, functions, and classes.

Objects Have Attributes and Methods: Every object in Python has attributes (characteristics or properties) and methods (functions associated with the object). Attributes are accessed using dot notation (object.attribute) and methods are called using the same notation (object.method()).

Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means that the type of an object is determined at runtime. Variables are simply references to objects, and they can refer to objects of any type.

Objects are Mutable or Immutable: Objects in Python can be mutable (modifiable) or immutable (unchangeable). Immutable objects, like integers and strings, cannot be modified after they are created. Mutable objects, like lists and dictionaries, can be modified in place.

Object Identity and Equality: Every object in Python has a unique identity, which can be obtained using the id() function. The is operator is used to check if two variables refer to the same object, while the == operator is used to check if two objects have the same value.
