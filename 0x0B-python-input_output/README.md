Python Input/Output (I/O) operations are fundamental for interacting with users, reading from files, and writing data to files. Here's an overview of how to perform basic I/O operations in Python:

Input from User:
To take input from the user, you can use the input() function. It reads a line from the input and returns it as a string.

Output to the Console:
You can print data to the console using the print() function.

Reading from a File:
To read data from a file, you can use the open() function to open the file in read mode ('r') and then use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the content.


Writing to a File:
To write data to a file, you can open the file in write mode ('w') or append mode ('a') using the open() function and then use the write() method to write data to the file.

Handling File Paths:
When working with files, it's often necessary to handle file paths. Python provides the os.path module to work with file paths in a platform-independent way.

Closing Files:
It's important to close files after you've finished working with them. However, using the with statement (context manager) ensures that files are automatically closed after use.
