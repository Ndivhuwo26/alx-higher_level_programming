SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is widely used for querying, updating, and managing data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). Here are some key points about SQL:

Purpose and Use Cases
Data Retrieval: SQL is primarily used to query databases and retrieve specific information from one or more tables. The most common operation for this is the SELECT statement.
Data Manipulation: SQL allows for the insertion (INSERT), updating (UPDATE), and deletion (DELETE) of data in a database.
Data Definition: SQL includes commands for defining the structure of a database, such as creating, altering, and dropping tables and other database objects. These operations are handled by CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements.
Data Control: SQL provides commands to control access to data in the database. This includes granting and revoking permissions to users with GRANT and REVOKE statements.
Transaction Control: SQL includes commands to manage transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Common commands include BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK.
Key Components
Tables: The basic unit of data storage in a relational database, consisting of rows and columns.
Queries: Requests to access data from the database, typically using the SELECT statement.
Joins: Operations that combine rows from two or more
